Primal attack, LWE challenge n=41, alpha=0.0150
Chose 156 samples. Predict solution at bkz-54 + svp-87

GSO precision:  long double
Intial Slope = -0.07355

Starting a fpylll BKZ-10 tour. 
slope: -0.07305, walltime: 0.625 sec
Without otf, would expect solution at pump-103. n_max=70 in the given time.

slope: -0.07195, walltime: 1.983 sec
Without otf, would expect solution at pump-103. n_max=75 in the given time.
