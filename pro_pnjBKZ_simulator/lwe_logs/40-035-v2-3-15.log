-------------------------
Primal attack, LWE challenge n=40, alpha=0.0350
Chose 187 samples. Predict solution at bkz-114 + svp-148

GSO precision:  qd
Intial Slope = -0.03524

Without otf, would expect solution at pump-129, estimate time cost = 12481.468 s 
Starting svp pump_{37, 151, 22}, n_max = 129
